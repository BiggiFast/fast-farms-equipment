        This equipment sale is more than just a transaction—it's a tribute to my father, Doug, who passed away one year ago.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Dad spent his life working the land. He knew every piece of equipment here like an old friend. Each tractor, each implement, each truck has a story—early mornings, long days, and the quiet satisfaction of a job well done.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        He never got the retirement he deserved. The kind where you sit on the porch, watch the sun set over fields you've tended for decades, and finally rest. Life had other plans.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        So this is my way of finishing what he started. Finding good homes for the equipment he cared for. Making sure his legacy lives on in the hands of other farmers, other families, other dreamers who understand what it means to work the earth.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Every piece here was maintained with pride. Dad wouldn't have had it any other way.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        If you're reading this and you find something you need, know that you're not just buying equipment. You're carrying forward a piece of a life well-lived.
      </p>
